# File Sorter

Getting more comfortable with Python, I decided to take upon a task that would take a lot of understanding of the language to execute it into existence. I chose a file sorter then as a way of streamlining the process of organizing my files easier on my desktop, I went further with it, designing a very minimal user interface that did the job.

## How It Works

- It works with the simple principle of organizing files in a given folder with it's filetypes.
- The `fileExtensions.py` consists a map with each file type to a certain folder name.
- The main program looks for all singular scattered files in a given desktop location, ignoring all folders.
- And it proceeds to create folders for each depending on the map of the file extensions.
- Assuming the program has permission to move items in the given location, it will proceed to move the files to their designated folder.

## Latest Add
- Added the functionality to call it through command-line
- You can call it either through:
```
python "Path/To/PythonFile" "Path/To/Directory/To/Be/Sorted"
eg. python "C:/Users/test/FileSorter/fileSort.py" "C:/Users/test/Downloads"
```
- Or alternatively, with a slight setup process, you can run "FileSort" in any terminal and it'll sort the CWD.

## Setup for FileSort PWSH/Windows Function

- 1. Open Powershell, type the command `notepad $PROFILE`
- 2. Add a function to the profile:

```
function FileSort {
    $cwd = Get-Location
    python "Path/To/PyFile" $cwd # Change Path/To/PyFile with the location where the python file is saved.
}
```

- 3. After the setup, you can run the command "fileSort" in any folder, with which, it's going to sort all the files in the current folder.

## Setup for FileSort bash/zsh Function

- 1. Open your zsh/bash config file
- 2. Add this code to the config:

```
function FileSort() {
    python "Path/To/PyFile" . # Change Path/To/PyFile with the location where the python file is saved.
}
```

- 3. After the setup, you can run the command "fileSort" in any folder, with which, it's going to sort all the files in the current folder.

## Requirements

- As the file was compiled into an executable which can be found in the Releases section, there are no requirements for it to be ran.
- However, if you want to compile and run the program yourself, you would require:
- Python3: As this project was built entirely with Python, Python3 is required with the latest version being recommended.
- The libraries used which need to be installed are `tkinter` and `customtkinter`, as these were used to make the user interface for the program.
- You can install them by:
- ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  or
- ```
  pip install tk customtkinter
  ```

## Future Enhancements

- Possible ideas for future improvements would be giving users the option to sort file types into their own folders with a setup process that would be done upon installation. Although, same effect can be achieved by editing the `fileExtensions.py` and configuring it to your own need and recompiling the program.
- Adding more file types.
